## Intuition

**Gaze Pattern Recognition in Dyadic Communication**

Analyzing gaze behaviors is crucial to interpret the nature of communication. Current studies on gaze have focused primarily on the detection of a single pattern, such as the Looking-At-Each-Other pattern or the shared attention pattern. In this work, we re-define five static gaze patterns that cover all the status during a dyadic communication and propose an end-to-end network to recognize these mutual exclusive gaze patterns given a static image. We annotate a benchmark, namely GP-Static, for the gaze pattern recognition task, on which our model experimentally outperforms other alternate solutions. On other two single gaze pattern tasks, our model also achieves the state-of-art performance. Gaze pattern analysis on preschool children demonstrates that the statistic of the proposed classification of the static gaze patterns conforms with the findings in psychology.
